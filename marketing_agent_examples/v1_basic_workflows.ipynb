    "# Basic agentic workflows, for a marketing agent use case\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through 3 simple multi-LLM workflows, with the use case of a marketing agent being the guiding example throughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt-chaining**: Decompose a task into sequential subtasks, where eaech step builds on previous results.\n",
    "2. **Parallelization**: Distributes independent subtasks across multiple LLMs or concurrent processing.\n",
    "3. **Routing**: Dynamically selects specialized LLM paths based on input characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our motivating example will be creating a restaurant marketing AI agent that writes marketing copy across various mediums (email blast, blog post, social media). We'll see how each of these methods approaches this task."

    "2. **Multi-Modal Content Suggestions**: Add suggested image ideas, emojis, or video concepts (e.g., \"Include a boomerang of the buffet line\").\n",
    "3. **Tone Personalization per Platform**: Refine tone/style per platform (e.g., more playful for Instagram, more informative for Facebook).\n",
    "4. **Post Length Constraints**: Add token/character length awareness to fit platform constraints (e.g., 2200 characters for Instagram captions).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Campaign management and scheduling\n",
    "1. **Calendar-Ready Content Planner**: Generate suggested post date/times for each post based on platform engagement heuristics (e.g., Sunday 10am for brunch promos).\n",
    "2. **Hashtag Strategy Generator**: Dynamically generate and rank hashtags based on popularity, competition, and niche relevance.\n",
    "3. **Post Lifecycle Planner**: Suggest how and when to repurpose or recycle the same content (e.g., turn blog post → IG Reel script 1 week later).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Audience targeting + optimization\n",
    "1. **Persona-Based Copy Rewriter**: Rewrite the same post for different audience segments (e.g., families vs. fitness enthusiasts).\n",
    "2. **Geo/Location Targeting Variants**: Tailor content for specific locales.\n",
    "3. **Lookalike Audience Descriptor**: Generate ad audience descriptors for Meta Ads / Instagram Ads based on post content + campaign goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance Evaluation + Feedback Loop\n",
    "1. **Post Scorer + Optimizer**: Score each post on engagement potential, clarity, tone fit, and CTA strength — then revise weak ones.\n",
    "2. **Analytics Interpretation Agent**: After campaign runs, interpret real metrics (CTR, likes, comments) and recommend refinements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Agent-Oriented Extensions\n",
    "1. **Post + Comment Strategy Agent**: Generate a suggested pinned comment or post follow-up comment to boost visibility.\n",
    "2. **Cross-Platform Auto-Translator**: Rewrite and adapt content across multiple social platforms with tone + format variation.\n",
    "3. **Real-Time Trend Watcher Agent**: Inject trending audio, memes, or formats from social platforms into new post suggestions."
